\begin{conclusion}
In the first chapter, the Flutter framework as a new promising cross-platform framework was introduced. How the framework works, its philosophy ``everything is a widget'' was explained and different approaches of state management were discussed. 

Next chapter was focused on introducing proposed application, on its designing process, prototyping and user testing. As was described, Low-Fidelity and High-Fidelity prototypes were created to verify proposed design. Both prototypes are also included along with final implementation in the appendix. 

In the implementation, more details were covered and also introduced several popular packages and solutions within Flutter community. In the end, \textit{Android} version was successfully tested and released for everyone. 

\section{Next Steps}
Coffee Time is for sure not ``feature-complete'' and there is plenty of space to improvements. Ongoing future development is planned to obtain more experience with Flutter framework and bring an even better, feature ``rich'', application. 

Next possible features and steps can be:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Add missing feature ``searching cafes in custom location''.
    \item Synchonization of favorited cafes.
    \item Better map view with more information in it.
    \item Optimise application performance, responsivity and adaptability to different form factors, screen sizes and resolutions.
    \item Add full \textit{iOS} support. This includes redesign of the application to more modern cross-platform look. 
    \item As a experiment, build application also for web and desktop platform.
\end{itemize}

Personal author's note to the end

I really believe that Flutter is a promising framework, which increasingly gains on popularity and in the closest future there will be more opportunities as the framework will get adopted by larger companies. In contrast with Xamarin, my subjective opinion is that the Flutter development workflow is faster, more convenient and easier to use. Of course, as with every new popular framework, there is no guarantee that Flutter will be truly the right solution in the future. I believe that at this moment companies can use Flutter for applications, which do not require specific platform functionalities, such as virtual reality, without any doubt.
